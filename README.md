Mastermind is a code-breaking game. The goal is to guess the secret code in the least amount of guesses.

The secret code consists of a sequence of unique colors. The amount of colors and positions can be set in the settings.

After each guess, you will receive feedback about the amount of correct colors and the amount of correct colors in the correct position.

Originally, the feedback is given in the form of black and white pins. Black pins indicate the amount of correct colors in the correct position, white pins indicate the amount of correct colors in the wrong position.

Good luck!
